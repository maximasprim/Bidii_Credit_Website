      "Most borrowers focus on the headline interest rate and stop there. The number that actually determines whether a loan is affordable is the monthly repayment against your income, not the rate on its own.",
      "Before signing anything, check four things: the total repayment amount, the monthly figure, whether the rate is flat or reducing balance, and whether there are charges outside the stated rate.",
      "A flat rate is calculated on the full original amount for the whole term, while a reducing balance rate is calculated only on what's still outstanding. Two loans with the same headline rate can cost very different amounts depending on which method is used.",
